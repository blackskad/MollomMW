 MollomMW: A Mollom plugin for MediaWiki
=========================================

MollomMW is a extension for mediawiki to fight spam. All edits will be checked
against the Mollom webservice to see if they're ham or spam. Spam messages are
discarded, ham messages are accepted. If Mollom is unsure about the content, the
user will have to solve a CAPTCHA.

For more information on Mollom, see http://www.mollom.com/

= Requirements =

* An account at http://www.mollom.com/ and a valid keypair.
* A working MediaWiki installation. The installation directory will be refered
  to as $MEDIAWIKI_DIR.
* php-xmlrpc should be installed

= Basic Installation =

* Copy the MollomMW directory to $MEDIAWIKI_DIR/extensions
* Point mediawiki to the extension and add your public and private Mollom key to
  $MEDIAWIKI_DIR/LocalSettings.php, see below:

$wgMollomPublicKey = 'yourpublickey';
$wgMollomPrivateKey = 'yourprivatekey';
require_once($IP . '/extensions/mollommw/mollommw.php');

* You're ready to go!

= Optional configuration =

These configuration values are optional and mostly useful for users with special
needs, like companies with complicated setups and dedicated servers.

* $wgMollomMWAcceptPolicy: a bool indicating the policy that should be followed
  for edits from the website when all Mollom servers are down. true means all
  messages are accepted, false means all messages are rejected. Default value
  is true.
* $wgMollomMWAPIAcceptPolicy: a bool indicating the policy that should be
  followed for edits from the api when all Mollom servers are down. true means
  all messages are accepted, false means all messages are rejected. Default
  value is false.

* $wgMollomMWSpecialRights: a bool indicating if the special user permissions
  should be used. See the section below for more information on the subject.

* $wgMollomReverseProxyAddresses: a list of ip addresses for reverse proxies.
  This allows the wiki to provide a more accurate ip to mollom,
  which increases the accuracy of Mollom.
  (see http://mollom.com/api/handling-author-ip-addresses for more information)
* $wgMollomRunsOnClusterSetup: a boolean value, indicating whether this setup runs
  on a cluster or not. This allows the wiki to provide a more accurate ip to mollom,
  which increases the accuracy of Mollom.
  (see http://mollom.com/api/handling-author-ip-addresses for more information)

* $wgMollomDebug: outputs debug message from the extension to
  $MEDIAWIKI_DIR/extensions/mollommw/debug.log

= Advanced User Permissions =

For some users, you might want to check for spam, but don't show a captcha. Or
you don't want to do any check at all. Sysops, for example, are not likely to
post any spam, so you might want to skip the check for those users.
This can also be used to reduce the number of checks/captcha's that are send to
Mollom, to stay within the limits of your Mollom subscription.

The sysop group also has the special mollommw-admin permission. This permission
grants them access to the special pages to manage blacklists, see statistics,...

MollomMW permissions:
* mollommw-admin: manage Mollom blacklists and see statistics
* mollommw-no-check: don't perform any check on the edit, don't show a captcha
* mollommw-no-captcha: perform a check on the edit, but accept when unsure

If $wgMollomMWSpecialRights is true, mollommw will set the following default permissions:
* sysop       => mollommw-no-check
* bureaucrat  => mollommw-no-check
* email       => mollommw-no-captcha
