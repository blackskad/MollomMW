 MollomMW: A Mollom plugin for MediaWiki
=========================================

MollomMW is a extension for mediawiki to fight spam. All edits will be checked
against the Mollom webservice to see if they're ham or spam. Spam messages are
discarded, ham messages are accepted. If Mollom is unsure about the content, the
user will have to solve a CAPTCHA.

For more information on Mollom, see http://www.mollom.com/

These configuration values are optional and mostly useful for users with special
needs, like companies with complicated setups and dedicated servers.

* $wgMollomServerList: a list of (dedicated) Mollom-servers.
